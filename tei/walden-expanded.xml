                     <rdg wit="#wc_0d">work.<del>I remember to have met once a particularly wretched
                           man in our own streets, asking for a lodging, whom it was almost no
                           pleasure to befriend he so was hopeless. He had come all the way from New
                           York on foot, seeking work, but he did not know where he was at any time,
                           only, perchance, that he had travelled thirty miles that day, when three
                           would have done as well. He thought that he had seriously injured himself
                           by lying out, but he was more seriously injured before. He could do work
                           about a stable, but declared in a disconsolate voice, that there was no
                           work for him, as if the fates had a spite against him. I saw by his face
                           that he was only a more desperate man than usual, whose whole life was a
                           crime, who was endeavoring to escape from himself, but for once, derived
                           no amusement from the method which he had chosen. He thought that nobody
                           wished to employ him nor would respect him, because he knew that he was
                           unworthy to be employed, and did not respect himself; and thus he had
                           come two hundred and fifty miles in a straight line, with desperate
                           steps, offering himself, with a down look, anticipating failure, to do
                           stable work at such stable yards as this path happened to intersect,
                           doing his part as he would fain have believed, toward getting work; but
                           the truth was, he merely wished to convince the fates that he was willing
                           to do his part, when he was not. And so, judging from his direction, he
                           would go on, if his constitution held out, to the Gulf of St Lawrence,
                           where he would probably jump in. I knew very well that he was not the
                           only man who had not succeeded in getting work.</del>

               the ground, cellar fashion, six or seven feet deep, as long and as broad as they
               think proper, case the earth inside with wood all round the wall, and line the wood
               with the bark of trees or something else to prevent the caving in of the earth; floor
               this cellar with plank, and wainscot it overhead for a ceiling, raise a roof of spars
               clear up, and cover the spars with bark or green sods, so that they can live dry and
               warm in these houses with their entire families for two, three, and four years, it
               being understood that partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to
               the size of the family. The wealthy and principal men in New England, in the

               of three or four years, when the country became adapted to agriculture, they built

               woodchucks, and so became a dead cat at last. </p>

                        continued habit of handling it. Of course a great deal of work which was
                        done in advance in order to be prepared for the workmen to follow was lost,
                        and had to be done over again. Not only fresh snow had to be cropped off the
                        same area, but a rain or thaw succeeded by cold filled the grooves with ice
                        and spoiled that work; or worst of all rain &amp; snow together might cover
                        the whole pond for the whole winter many inches deep with imperfect ice
                        which must be planed off. However, they removed this very fast. The plane
                        which was as wide as a cake took off 2 inches each bout &amp; 3 horses could
                        break up as much as 10 could carry off. They used a rope with buoys to fence
                        and haul in the ice already cut when the wind blew it off shore. The ice is
                        commonly cut on the leeward side of the pond, so that the wind need not blow
                        the water over the edge into the grooves, where it would freeze and spoil
                        much work. They put snow into the ends of the grooves next the water to keep
                        it out. When it was necessary to scrape up much snow it sank the ice under
                        &amp; so impeded the work. Also the ice sank &amp; wore out where the men
                        stood on boards to load it, until the water stood above it, and the waves
                        also ate it away—so that they were obliged every day or two to occupy a new
                        place.</rdg>

                        appears as follows. Every class and order in the universe is the bearer of certain gifts to
                  man. There is a whole class of musk-bearing animals—and each flower has its
                  peculiar odor—and all these together go to make the general wholesome and
                  invigorating atmosphere. So each man should take care to emit his fragrance, and
                  perform some such office as hemlock boughs, <del>and</del> dried and healing
                  herbs—I want the flower and fruit of a man—and that some fragrance <add>as</add>
                  of fresh spring life be wafted over from him to me—This is consolation and that
                  charity that hides a multitude of sins. He must serve another and a better use
                  than any he can consciously render. We demand to discover at least some signs of
                  life, some vegetation and putting forth of natural life in him. Some greenness,
                  some flowering—some ripeness. He must be a sort of appreciable wealth to us, or at
                  least make us sensible of our own riches—in his degree an Apollo—a Mercury—a
                  Ceres—a Minerva—or the bearer of divine gifts to me. He must bring me the morning
                  light untarnished, &amp; the evening red undimmed—The hilarity of Spring in his
                  mirth—the summer’s serenity in his joy—the autumnal ripeness in his wisdom—and the
                  repose and abundance of winter in his silence. A man should impart his courage and
                  not his despair—his health and ease and not his disease, and take care that this
                  does not spread by contagion. It has been well said that our purest and loftiest
                  joys have no memory of, or faith in, one another, and hence we need that he of our
                  fellows who last travelled to the sources of the sun—drank at the well of life—or
                  tasted the fountain of God—should communicate to us some of their inspiration.</ab>

                     is the choicest of relics. It is something at once more intimate with us and
                     more universal than any other work of art. It is the work of art nearest to
                     life itself. It may be translated into every language, and not only be read but
                     actually breathed from all human lips;—not be represented on canvas or in
                     marble only, but be carved out of the breath of life itself. The symbol of an
                     ancient man’s thought becomes a modern man’s speech. Two thousand summers have
                     imparted to the monuments of Grecian literature, as to her marbles, only a
                     maturer golden and autumnal tint, for they have carried their own serene and
                     celestial atmosphere into all lands to protect them against the corrosion of
                     time. Books are the treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of
                     generations and nations. Books, the oldest and the best, stand naturally and
                     rightfully on the shelves of every cottage. They have no cause of their own to
                     plead, but while they enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will
                     not refuse them. Their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in
                     every society, and, more than kings or emperors, exert an influence on mankind.
                     When the illiterate and perhaps scornful trader has earned by enterprise and
                     industry his coveted leisure and independence, and is admitted to the circles
                     of wealth and fashion, he turns inevitably at last to those still higher but
                     yet inaccessible circles of intellect and genius, and is sensible only of the
                     imperfection of his culture and the vanity and insufficiency of all his riches,
                     and further proves his good sense by the pains which be takes to secure for his
                     children that intellectual culture whose want he so keenly feels; and thus it
                     is that he becomes the founder of a family. </lem>

                  <lem>I think that having learned our letters we should read the best that is in
                     literature, and not be forever repeating our a b abs,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-027"></anchor> and words of one syllable, in the fourth or fifth
                     classes, sitting on the lowest and foremost form<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-028"></anchor> all our lives. Most men are satisfied if they read or
                     hear read, and perchance have been convicted by the wisdom of one good book,
                     the Bible, and for the rest of their lives vegetate and dissipate their
                     faculties in what is called easy reading. There is a work in several volumes in
                     our Circulating Library entitled Little Reading,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-029"></anchor> which I thought referred to a town of that name<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-030"></anchor> which I had not been to. There are those who,
                     like cormorants and ostriches,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-031"></anchor> can digest
                     all sorts of this, even after the fullest dinner of meats and vegetables, for
                     they suffer nothing to be wasted. If others are the machines to provide this
                     provender, they are the machines to read it. They read the nine thousandth tale
                     about Zebulon and Sophronia,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-032"></anchor> and how they
                     loved as none had ever loved before, and neither did the course of their true
                     love run smooth,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-033"></anchor>—at any rate, how it did
                     run and stumble, and get up again and go on! how some poor unfortunate got up
                     onto a steeple,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-034"></anchor> who had better never have
                     gone up as far as the belfry; and then, having needlessly got him up there, the
                     happy novelist rings the bell for all the world to come together and hear, O
                     dear! how he did get down again! For my part, I think that they had better
                     metamorphose all such aspiring heroes of universal noveldom into man
                     weathercocks, as they used to put heroes among the constellations, and let them
                     swing round there till they are rusty, and not come down at all to bother
                     honest men with their pranks. The next time the novelist rings the bell I will
                     not stir though the meeting-house burn down. “The Skip of the Tip-Toe-Hop, a
                     Romance of the Middle Ages,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-035"></anchor> by the
                     celebrated author of ‘Tittle-Tol-Tan,’<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-036"></anchor> to

                     erect and primitive curiosity, and with unwearied gizzard, whose corrugations
                     even yet need no sharpening, just as some little four-year-old bencher<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-038"></anchor> his two-cent gilt-covered edition of

                     accent, or emphasis, or any more skill in extracting or inserting the moral.
                     The result is dulness of sight, a stagnation of the vital circulations, and a
                     general deliquium and sloughing off of all the intellectual faculties. This
                     sort of gingerbread is baked daily and more sedulously than pure wheat or

                     <lem>The best books are not read even by those who are called good readers.
                        What does our Concord culture amount to? There is in this town, with a very
                        few exceptions, no taste for the best or for very good books even in English
                        literature, whose words all can read and spell. Even the college-bred and so
                        called liberally educated men here and elsewhere have really little or no
                        acquaintance with the English classics; and as for the recorded wisdom of
                        mankind, the ancient classics and Bibles, which are accessible to all who
                        will know of them, there are the feeblest efforts any where made to become
                        acquainted with them. I know a woodchopper, of middle age,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-053"></anchor> who takes a French paper, not for news as he says,
                        for he is above that, but to “keep himself in practice,” he being a Canadian
                        by birth; and when I ask him what he considers the best thing he can do in
                        this world, he says, beside this, to keep up and add to his English. This is
                        about as much as the college bred generally do or aspire to do, and they
                        take an English paper for the purpose. One who has just come from reading
                        perhaps one of the best English books will find how many with whom he can
                        converse about it? Or suppose he comes from reading a Greek or Latin classic
                        in the original, whose praises are familiar even to the so called
                        illiterate; he will find nobody at all to speak to, but must keep silence
                        about it. Indeed, there is hardly the professor in our colleges, who, if he
                        has mastered the difficulties of the language, has proportionally mastered
                        the difficulties of the wit and poetry of a Greek poet, and has any sympathy
                        to impart to the alert and heroic reader; and as for the sacred Scriptures,
                        or Bibles of mankind, who in this town can tell me even their titles? Most
                        men do not know that any nation but the Hebrews have had a scripture. A man,
                        any man, will go considerably out of his way to pick up a silver dollar; but
                        here are golden words, which the wisest men of antiquity have uttered, and
                        whose worth the wise of every succeeding age have assured us of;—and yet we

               </note>We boast that we belong to the nineteenth century and are making the most
               rapid strides of any nation. But consider how little this village does for its own
               culture. I do not wish to flatter my townsmen, nor to be flattered by them, for that
               will not advance either of us. We need to be provoked,—goaded like oxen, as we are,
               into a trot. We have a comparatively decent system of common schools, schools for
               infants only; but excepting the half-starved Lyceum in the winter,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-063"></anchor> and latterly the puny beginning of a library suggested by the
                  state,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-064"></anchor> no school for ourselves. We spend
               more on almost any article of bodily aliment or ailment than on our mental aliment.
               It is time that we had uncommon schools,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-065"></anchor> that
               we did not leave off our education when we begin to be men and women. It is time that
               villages were universities, and their elder inhabitants the fellows of universities,
               with leisure—if they are, indeed, so well off—to pursue liberal studies the rest of
               their lives. Shall the world be confined to one Paris or one Oxford forever? Cannot
               students be boarded here and get a liberal education under the skies of Concord? Can
               we not hire some Abelard<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-066"></anchor> to lecture to us?
               Alas! what with foddering the cattle and tending the store, we are kept from school
               too long, and our education is sadly neglected. In this country, the village should
               in some respects take the place of the nobleman of Europe. It should be the patron of
               the fine arts. It is rich enough. It wants only the magnanimity and refinement. It
               can spend money enough on such things as farmers and traders value, but it is thought
               Utopian to propose spending money for things which more intelligent men know to be of
               far more worth. This town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on a town-house, thank
               fortune or politics,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-067"></anchor> but probably it will not
               spend so much on living wit, the true meat to put into that shell, in a hundred
               years. The one hundred and twenty-five dollars<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-068"></anchor>
               annually subscribed for a Lyceum in the winter is better spent than any other equal
               sum raised in the town. If we live in the nineteenth century, why should we not enjoy
               the advantages which the nineteenth century offers? Why should our life be in any
               respect provincial? If we will read newspapers, why not skip the gossip of Boston and
               take the best newspaper in the world at once?—not be sucking the pap of “neutral
               family” papers,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-069"></anchor> or browsing “Olive-Branches”
               here in New England.<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-070"></anchor> Let the reports of all the
               learned societies come to us, and we will see if they know any thing. Why should we
               leave it to Harper &amp; Brothers and Redding &amp; Co.<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-071"></anchor> to select our reading?<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-072"></anchor>
               As the nobleman of cultivated taste surrounds himself with whatever conduces to his
               culture,—genius—learning—wit—books—paintings—statuary—music—philosophical
               instruments, and the like; so let the village do,—not stop short at a pedagogue, a
               parson, a sexton, a parish library, and three selectmen,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-073"></anchor> because our pilgrim forefathers<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-074"></anchor> got through a cold winter once on a bleak rock with these. To
               act collectively is according to the spirit of our institutions; and I am confident
               that, as our circumstances are more flourishing, our means are greater than the
               nobleman’s. New England can hire all the wise men in the world to come and teach her,
               and board them round the while,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-03-075"></anchor> and not be
               provincial at all. That is the <hi rend="style(italics)">uncommon</hi> school we
               want. Instead of noblemen, let us have noble villages of men. If it is necessary,
               omit one bridge over the river, go round a little there, and throw one arch at least
               over the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds us. </p>

                        grows before my door unlike any symbol or glyphic I have seen painted. Where are the heroes
                        whose exploits shall appear to posterity sculptured on monuments amid such natural forms as
                        these? As we see heroes and demigods amid the lotuses and palms of the east. Where are the new

               morning by the light of the stars amid the mountains, to fodder and harness his steed. Fire, too, was
               awakened thus early to put the vital beat in him and get him off. If the enterprise were as innocent as
               it is early! If the snow lies deep, they strap on his snow-shoes, and with the giant plow, plow a furrow
               from the mountains to the seaboard, in which the cars, like a following drill-barrow, sprinkle all the
               restless men and floating merchandise in the country for seed. All day the fire-steed flies over the
               country, stopping only that his master may rest, and I am awakened by his tramp and defiant snort at
               midnight, when in some remote glen in the woods he fronts the elements incased in ice and snow; and <app xml:id="walc04-app-0103">

               extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will
               cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer, the Manilla hemp and cocoa-nut husks, the old
               junk, gunny bags, scrap iron, and rusty nails. This car-load of torn sails is more legible and
               interesting now than if they should be wrought into paper and printed books. Who can write so graphically
               the history of the storms they have weathered as these rents have done? They are proof-sheets which need
               no correction. Here goes lumber from the Maine woods, which did not go out to sea in the last freshet,
               risen four dollars on the thousand because of what did go out or was split up; pine, spruce,
               cedar,—first, second, third and fourth qualities, so lately all of one quality, to wave over the bear,
               and moose, and caribou. Next rolls Thomaston lime, a prime lot, which will get far among the hills before
               it gets slacked. These rags in bales, of all hues and qualities, the lowest condition to which cotton and
               linen descend, the final result of dress,—of patterns which are now no longer cried up, unless it be in
               Milwaukie, as those splendid articles, English, French, or American prints, ginghams, muslins, &amp;c.,
               gathered from all quarters both of fashion and poverty, going to become paper of one color or a few
               shades only, on which forsooth will be written tales of real life, high and low, and founded on fact!
               This closed car smells of salt fish, the strong New England and commercial scent, reminding me of the
               Grand Banks and the fisheries. Who has not seen a salt fish, thoroughly cured for this world, so that
               nothing can spoil it, and putting the perseverance of the saints to the blush? with which you may sweep
               or pave the streets, and split your kindlings, and the teamster shelter himself and his lading against
               sun wind and rain behind it,— and the trader, as a Concord trader once did, hang it up by his door for a
               sign when he commences business, until at last his oldest customer cannot tell surely whether it be
               animal, vegetable, or mineral, and yet it shall be as pure as a snowflake, and if it be put into a pot
               and boiled, will come out an excellent dun fish for a Saturday’s dinner. Next Spanish hides, with the
               tails still preserving their twist and the angle of elevation they had when the oxen that wore them were
               careering over the pampas of the Spanish main,—a type of all obstinacy, and evincing how almost hopeless
               and incurable are all constitutional vices. I confess, that practically speaking, when I have learned a
               man’s real disposition, I have no hopes of changing it for the better or worse in this state of
               existence. As the Orientals say, “A cur’s tail may be warmed, and pressed, and bound round with
               ligatures, and after a twelve years’ labor bestowed upon it, still it will retain its natural form.” The
               only effectual cure for such inveteracies as these tails exhibit is to make glue of them, which I believe
               is what is usually done with them, and then they will stay put and stick. Here is a hogshead of molasses
               or of brandy directed to John Smith, Cuttingsville, Vermont, some trader among the Green Mountains, who
               imports for the farmers near his clearing, and now perchance stands over his bulk-head and thinks of the
               last arrivals on the coast, how they may affect the price for him, telling his customers this moment, as
               he has told them twenty times before this morning, that he expects some by the next train of prime
               quality. It is advertised in the Cuttingsville Times. </p>

                While these things go up
               other things come down. Warned by the whizzing sound, I look up from my book and see some tall pine, hewn
               on far northern hills, which has winged its way over the Green Mountains and the Connecticut, shot like
               an arrow through the township within ten minutes, and scarce another eye beholds it; going <quote>

               their sticks, and shepherd boys in the midst of their flocks, all but the mountain pastures, whirled
               along like leaves blown from the mountains by the September gales. The air is filled with the bleating of
               calves and sheep, and the hustling of oxen, as if a pastoral valley were going by. When the old
               bell-wether at the head rattles his bell, the mountains do indeed skip like rams and the little hills
               like lambs. A car-load of drovers, too, in the midst, on a level with their droves now, their vocation
               gone, but still clinging to their useless sticks as their badge of office. But their dogs, where are
               they? It is a stampede to them; they are quite thrown out; they have lost the scent. Methinks I hear them
               barking behind the Peterboro’ Hills, or panting up the western slope of the Green Mountains. They will
               not be in at the death. Their vocation, too, is gone. Their fidelity and sagacity are below par now. They
               will slink back to their kennels in disgrace, or perchance run wild and strike a league with the wolf and
               the fox. So is your pastoral life whirled past and away. But the bell rings, and I must get off the track

                  Sometimes, on Sundays, I heard the bells, the Lincoln, Acton, Bedford, or Concord
                  bell, when the wind was favorable, a faint, sweet, and, as it were, natural melody, worth importing
                  into the wilderness.</seg>

               Instead of no path to the front-yard gate in the Great Snow,—no gate,—no front-yard,—and no path to the

               same time conscious of a slight insanity in my mood, and seemed to foresee my
               recovery. In the midst of a gentle rain while these thoughts prevailed, <app xml:id="walc05-app-0046">

               advantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have never thought of them
               since. Every little pine needle expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended me.
               I was so distinctly made aware of the presence of something kindred to me, even in
               scenes which we are accustomed to call wild and dreary, and also that the nearest of
               blood to me and humanest was not a person nor a villager, that I thought no place
               could ever be strange to me again.— <quote>

               sharing no experience, but taking note of it; and that is no more I than it is you.
               When the play, it may be the tragedy, of life is over, the spectator goes his way. It
               was a kind of fiction, a work of the imagination only, so far as he was concerned.
               This doubleness may easily make us poor neighbors and friends sometimes. </p>

               had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day,
               and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had to
               agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this
               frequent meeting tolerable, and that we need not come to open war. We meet at the
               post-office, and at the sociable, and about the fireside every night; we live thick
               and are in each other’s way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus
               lose some respect for one another. Certainly less frequency would suffice for all
               important and hearty communications. Consider the girls in a factory,—never alone,

                     would come half a dozen <add>railroad</add> men to my house at once—healthy and
                     sturdy working men, descended from sound bodies of men, and still transmitting
                     arms &amp; legs &amp; bowels <del>from remote generations to posterity. They
                        had a rude wisdom and courtesy which I love.</del>

                     began to look upon me at last as one of their kin. One a handsome younger man a
                     sailor-like—Greek-like man—says to me to-day—“Sir, I like your notions—I think
                     I shall live so myself. Only I should like wilder country, where there
                        <del>is</del>
                     <add>was</add> more game. I have been among the Indians near Apallachicola. I
                     have lived with them. I like your kind of life. Good-day, I wish you success
                     and happiness." They came in troops on Sundays in clean shirts, with washed
                     hands &amp; faces, and fresh twigs in their hands. There appeared in some of
                     these men even at a distance, a genuine magnanimity equal to Greek or Roman, of
                     unexplored and uncontaminated descent—The expression of their grimmed &amp;
                     sunburnt features made me think of Epaminondas of Socrates &amp; Cato. The most
                     famous philosophers &amp; poets seem in some respects infantile beside the easy
                     and successful life of natural men. These faces—homely—hard and scarred like
                     the rocks, but human &amp; wise—embracing Copt, and Mussulman and all tribes
                     &amp; nations. One is a pacha or Sultan—Selim—or Mustapha or Mahmoud in
                     disguise. Circumstances and employment may conceal for a season but they do not
                     essentially alter the finer qualities of our nature. I observe among these men
                     when I meet them on the road an ineradicable refinement &amp; delicacy—as old
                     as the sun &amp; moon.—A fineness which is commonly thought to adorn the
                     drawing rooms only. There is no more real rudeness in laborers &amp; washer
                     women—than in gentlemen and ladies. Under some ancient wrinkled, almost forlorn
                     visage of an Indian chieftain slumbers all that was ever writ or spoken of man.
                     You can tell a nobleman’s head though he may be shovelling gravel beneath it
                     six rods off in the midst of a gang with a bandana handkerchief tied about it.
                     Such as are to succeed the worthies of history. Their humble occupation which
                     allows them to take no airs upon themselves seems their least
                     disadvantage—Civilization seems to make bright only the superficial film of the
                     eye. Most men are wrecked upon their consciousness. </ab>

               </note> When Winslow, afterward governor of the Plymouth Colony, went with a
               companion on a visit of ceremony to Massassoit on foot through the woods, and arrived

               </app> they were well received by the king, but nothing was said about eating that
               day. When the night arrived, to quote their own words,—“He laid us on the bed with
               himself and his wife, they at the one end and we at the other, it being only plank,
               laid a foot from the ground and a thin mat upon them. Two more of his chief men, for
               want of room, pressed by and upon us; so that we were worse weary of our lodging than
               of our journey." At one o’clock the next day Massassoit "brought two fishes that he
               had shot," about thrice as big as a bream; “these being boiled, there were at least
               forty looked for a share in them. The most ate of them. This meal only we had in two
               nights and a day; and had not one of us bought a partridge, we had taken our journey
               fasting." <app xml:id="walc06-app-0043">
                  <lem>Fearing that they would be light-headed for want of food and also sleep,
                     owing to “the savages’ barbarous singing, (for they use to sing themselves
                     asleep,)" and that they might get home while they had strength to travel, they
                     departed. As for lodging, it is true they were but poorly entertained, though
                     what they found an inconvenience was no doubt intended for an honor; but as far
                     as eating was concerned, I do not see how the Indians could have done better.
                     They had nothing to eat themselves, and they were wiser than to think that
                     apologies could supply the place of food to their guests; so they drew their
                     belts tighter and said nothing about it. Another time when Winslow visited

               was a vast bellows, and all the buildings expanded and collapsed alternately with a
               din. But sometimes it was a really noble and inspiring strain that reached these

               stand for trifles?—and looked round for a woodchuck or a skunk to exercise my

               of a march of crusaders in the horizon, with a slight tantivy and tremulous motion of
               the elm-tree <anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-07-039"></anchor> tops which

                        as slow as the pace of oxen. The difference between the ancients and us may
                        be seen in their different treatment of their fellow laborer the ox. We are
                        accustomed to say that the ox is more profitable than the horse, because it
                        not only costs less to keep it, but when it is past labor we can slaughter
                        it, and it will furnish food for our families—we treat it as a slave rather
                        than as a servant. If other nations, as the Egyptians, have been idolators
                        in this respect, and made animals objects of adoration, we have gone to the
                        other and an equally fatal extreme—for every animal should be approached
                        with a feeling of reverence.—“According to the early laws of Greece, the
                        ploughing ox was held sacred, and was entitled when past service, to range
                        the pastures in freedom and repose. It was forbidden, by decrees of
                        Triptolemus, to put to death this faithful ally of the labors of the
                        husbandman, who shared the toils of ploughing &amp; threshing. Whenever
                        therefore an ox was slaughtered, he must first be consecrated or devoted as
                        a sacrifice (<w xml:lang="gr">ίερειου</w>), by the sprinkling of the
                        sacrificial barley; this was a precaution against the barbarous practice of
                        eating raw flesh (<w xml:lang="gr">Вονφαγία</w>). A peculiar sacrifice (<w xml:lang="gr">Δμπόλια</w>) at Athens, at which a slayer of the ox fled,
                        and the guilty axe was thrown into the sea, on the sentence of the Prytanes,
                        yearly placed before the people a visible type of the first beginnings of
                        their social institutions." Ancient writers on agriculture speak of such
                        things as the “dignity of the herd." Varro suggests that the object of the
                        Argonautic expedition was a ram’s fleece—The golden apples of the Hesperides
                        were by the ambiguity of language goats and sheep which Hercules imported.
                        The stars and constellations bear their names. The Aegean sea has its name
                        from the goat—and famous mountains &amp; straits—as the Bosphorus or
                        ox-passage. Ovid makes Italy to be from <hi rend="style(underline)">vitulas</hi>. The fine or tax (mulcta a mulgendo) anciently paid in kind
                        refers to this. The oldest coins bore the figures of cattle—Our word
                        pecuniary is from the Latin pecunia which is from <hi rend="style(underline)">pecus</hi> or herd—which was the oldest currency
                        or medium of exchange. Celebrated Roman families have derived their names
                        from the same source. As Porcius

                        is worn out in our service, without a tear or token of gratitude. I learn
                        from one who frequents the market at Brighton, that cattle are frequently
                        starved 4 or 5 days before they are slaughtered, since it is found not to
                        cause any serious diminution in the weight of their solid parts. It was not

                  river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a
                  village of busy men, as curious to me as if they had been prairie dogs, each

                  Besides, there was a still more terrible standing invitation to call at every one
                  of these houses, and company expected about these times. For the most part I
                  escaped wonderfully from these dangers, either by proceeding at once boldly and
                  without deliberation to the goal, as is recommended to those who run the gantlet,
                  or by keeping my thoughts on high things, like Orpheus, who, “loudly singing the
                  praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices of the Sirens, and kept out of
                     danger.”<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-08-010"></anchor> Sometimes I

                A lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature. It is earth’s eye;

               are the slender eyelashes which fringe it, and the wooded hills and cliffs around are its overhanging

               birds passing just beneath my level on the right or left, their fins, like sails, set all around them.
               There were many such schools in the pond, apparently improving the short season before winter would draw
               an icy shutter over their broad skylight, sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight
               breeze struck it, or a few rain-drops fell there. When I approached carelessly and alarmed them, they
               made a sudden splash and rippling with their tails, as if <app xml:id="walc09-app-0259">

               wind rose, the mist increased, and the waves began to run, and the perch leaped much higher than before,
               half out of water, a hundred black points, three inches long, at once above the surface. Even as late as
               the fifth of December, <app xml:id="walc09-app-0260">

                But suddenly the dimples ceased, for they were produced by the perch, which the noise of my oars

               </note>When I first paddled a boat on Walden, it was completely surrounded by thick and lofty
               pine and oak woods, and in some of its coves grape vines had run over the trees next the water and formed
               bowers under which a boat could pass. The hills which form its shores are so steep, and the woods on them
               were then so high, that, as you looked down from the west end, it had the appearance of an amphitheatre
               for some kind of sylvan spectacle. I have spent many an hour, when I was younger, floating over its
               surface as the zephyr willed, having paddled my boat to the middle, and lying on my back across the
               seats, in a summer forenoon, dreaming awake, until I was aroused by the boat touching the sand, and I
               arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to; days when idleness was the most attractive and
               productive industry. Many a forenoon have I stolen away, preferring to spend thus the most valued part of
               the day; for I was rich, if not in money, in sunny hours and summer days, and spent them lavishly; nor do
               I regret that I did not waste more of <app xml:id="walc09-app-0276">

               similar chain of ponds through which in some other geological period it may have flowed, and by a little
               digging, which God forbid, it can be made to flow thither again. If by living thus reserved and

                        the summit of Monadnok. According to Shepherd’s "Clean Sunshine of the Gospel" the praying

                        before they finally settled at Nagog Pond on the west side of Concord. I used often to ascend
                        the cedar hill on the southeast side of this pond for the sake of the view, thence over to the
                        forest westward in which the towns are quite small, as far as the mist in the northwest horizon.

               Since the woodcutters, and the railroad, and I myself have profaned Walden, perhaps the most attractive,
               if not the most beautiful, of all our lakes, the gem of the woods, is White Pond;—a poor name from its
               commonness, whether derived from the remarkable purity of its waters or the color of its sands. In these
               as in other respects, however, it is a lesser twin of Walden. They are so much alike that you would say
               they must be connected under ground. It has the same stony shore, and its waters are of the same hue. As
               at Walden, in sultry dog-day weather, looking down through the woods on some of its bays which are not so
               deep but that the reflection from the bottom tinges them, its waters are of a misty bluish-green or

                  sand-paper
                  <anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-09-074"></anchor>
                with, and I have continued to visit it ever since. One who frequents it proposes to call it Virid

                Perhaps it might be called Yellow-Pine Lake, from the following circumstance. About fifteen years
               ago you could see the top of a pitch-pine, of the kind called yellow-pine hereabouts, though it is not a
               distinct species, projecting above the surface in deep water, many rods from the shore. It was even
               supposed by some that the pond had sunk, and this was one of the primitive forest that formerly stood
               there. I find that even so long ago as 1792, in a "Topographical Description of the Town of
                  Concord,"
                  <anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-09-076"></anchor>
                by one of its citizens, in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, the author,
               after speaking of Walden and White Ponds, adds, "In the middle of the latter may be seen, when the water
               is very low, a tree which appears as if it grew in the place where it now stands, although the roots are
               fifty feet below the surface of the water; the top of this tree is broken off, and at that place measures
               fourteen inches in diameter." In the spring of ’49 I talked with the man
                  <anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-09-077"></anchor>
                who lives nearest the pond in Sudbury, who told me that it was he who got out this tree ten or
               fifteen years before. As near as he could remember, it stood twelve or fifteen rods from the shore, where
               the water was thirty or forty feet deep. It was in the winter, and he had been getting out ice in the
               forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid of his neighbors, he would take out the
               old yellow-pine. He sawed a channel in the ice toward the shore, and hauled it over and along and out on
               to the ice with oxen; but, before he had gone far in his work, he was surprised to find that it was wrong
               end upward, with the stumps of the branches pointing down, and the small end firmly fastened in the sandy
               bottom. It was about a foot in diameter at the big end, and he had expected to get a good saw-log, but it
               was so rotten as to be fit only for fuel, if for that. He had some of it in his shed <app xml:id="walc09-app-0319">

               </note>I set out one afternoon to go a-fishing to Fair-Haven, through the woods, to eke out my
          scanty fare of vegetables. My way led through Pleasant Meadow, an adjunct of the Baker Farm, that retreat of
          which a poet has since sung, beginning, — <lg>
                  <l>“Thy entry is a pleasant field,</l>
                  <l>Which some mossy fruit trees yield</l>
                  <l>Partly to a ruddy brook,</l>
                  <l>By gliding musquash undertook,</l>
                  <l>And mercurial trout,</l>
                  <l>Darting about.”</l>
               </lg> I thought of living there before I went to Walden. I “hooked” the apples, leaped the brook, and scared
          the musquash and the trout. It was one of those afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one, in which
          many events may happen, a large portion of our natural life, though it was already half spent when I started.
          By the way there came up a shower, which compelled me to stand half an hour under a pine, piling boughs over
          my head, and wearing my handkerchief for a shed; and when at length I had made one cast over the
          pickerel-weed, standing up to my middle in water, I found myself suddenly in the shadow of a cloud, and the
          thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that I could do no more than listen to it. The gods must be proud,
          thought I, with such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. So I made haste for shelter to the
          nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road, but so much the nearer to the pond, and had long been
          uninhabited:— <lg>
                  <l>“And here a poet builded,</l>
                  <l>In the completed years,</l>
                  <l>For behold a trivial cabin</l>
                  <l>That to destruction steers.”</l>
               </lg> So the Muse fables. But therein, as I found, dwelt now John Field, an Irishman, and his wife, and
          several children, from the broad-faced boy who assisted his father at his work, and now came running by his
          side from the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like, cone-headed infant that sat upon its
          father’s knee as in the palaces of nobles, and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger
          inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not knowing but it was the last of a noble
          line, and the hope and cynosure of the world, instead of John Field’s poor starveling brat. There we sat
          together under that part of the roof which leaked the least, while it showered and thundered without. I had
          sat there many times of old before the ship was built that floated his family to America. An honest,
          hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his wife, she too was brave to cook so many
          successive dinners in the recesses of that lofty stove; with round greasy face and bare breast, still thinking
          to improve her condition one day; with the never absent mop in one hand, and yet no effects of it visible any
          where. The chickens, which had also taken shelter here from the rain, stalked about the room like members of
          the family, too humanized methought to roast well. They stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe
          significantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he worked “bogging” for a neighboring farmer,
          turning up a meadow with a spade or bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land with
          manure for one year, and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully at his father’s side the while, not
          knowing how poor a bargain the latter had made. I tried to help him with my experience, telling him that he
          was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came a-fishing here, and looked like a loafer, was
          getting my living like himself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which hardly cost more than
          the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts to; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or two
          build himself a palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter, nor milk, nor fresh meat,
          and so did not have to work to get them; again, as I did not work hard, I did not have to eat hard, and it
          cost me but a trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter, and milk, and beef, he had
          to work hard to pay for them, and when he had worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his
          system, — and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader than it was long, for he was
          discontented and wasted his life into the bargain; and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to America,
          that here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day. But the only true America is that country where
          you are at liberty to pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these, and where the state
          does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and other superfluous expenses which directly
          or indirectly result from the use of such things. For I purposely talked to him as if he were a philosopher,
          or desired to be one. I should be glad if all the meadows on the earth were left in a wild state, if that were
          the consequence of men’s beginning to redeem themselves. A man will not need to study history to find out what
          is best for his own culture. But alas! the culture of an Irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a
          sort of moral bog hoe. I told him, that as he worked so hard at bogging, he required thick boots and stout
          clothing, which yet were soon soiled and worn out, but I wore light shoes and thin clothing, which cost not
          half so much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman (which, however, was not the case,)
          and in an hour or two, without labor, but as a recreation, I could, if I wished, catch as many fish as I
          should want for two days, or earn enough money to support me a week. If he and his family would live simply,
          they might all go a-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement. John heaved a sigh at this, and his wife
          stared with arms a-kimbo, and both appeared to be wondering if they had capital enough to begin such a course
          with, or arithmetic enough to carry it through. It was sailing by dead reckoning to them, and they saw not
          clearly how to make their port so; therefore I suppose they still take life bravely, after their fashion, face
          to face, giving it tooth and nail, not having skill to split its massive columns with any fine entering wedge,
          and rout it in detail;—thinking to deal with it roughly, as one should handle a thistle. But they fight at an
          overwhelming disadvantage,—living, John Field, alas! without arithmetic, and failing so. </p>

               The shower was now over, and a rainbow above the eastern woods promised a fair evening; so
          I took my departure. When I had got without I asked for a drink, hoping to get a sight of the well bottom, to

              borne to my ear through the cleansed air, from I know not what quarter, my Good Genius seemed to say,—Go
              fish and hunt far and wide day by day,—farther and wider,—and rest thee by many brooks and hearth-sides
              without misgiving. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth. Rise free from care before the dawn, and
              seek adventures. Let the noon find thee by other lakes, and the night overtake thee every where at home.
              There are no larger fields than these, no worthier games than may here be played. Grow wild according to
              thy nature, like these sedges and brakes, which will never become English hay. Let the thunder rumble;
              what if it threaten ruin to farmers’ crops? that is not its errand to thee. Take shelter under the cloud,
              while they flee to carts and sheds. Let not to get a living be thy trade, but thy sport. Enjoy the land,

               meditation. I think that I am near the end of it. Leave me alone, then, for a while. But that we may not
               be delayed, you shall be digging the bait meanwhile. Angle-worms are rarely to be met with in these
               parts, where the soil was never fattened with manure; the race is nearly extinct. The sport of digging
               the bait is nearly equal to that of catching the fish, when one’s appetite is not too keen; and this you
               may have all to yourself to-day. I would advise you to set in the spade down yonder among the
               ground-nuts, where you see the johnswort<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-12-012"></anchor> waving. I think
               that I may warrant you one worm to every three sods you turn up, if you look well in among the roots of
               the grass, as if you were weeding. Or, if you choose to go farther, it will not be unwise, for I have
               found the increase of fair bait to be very nearly as the squares of the distances. </p>

                  mother, had their backs up and were fiercely spitting at me. </seg>

               rid of them; I even felt complimented by their regarding my house as a desirable
               shelter. They never molested me seriously, though they bedded with me; and they
               gradually disappeared, into what crevices I do not know, avoiding winter<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-13-010"></anchor> and unspeakable cold. </p>

               to resort to the northeast side of Walden, which the sun, reflected from the
               pitch-pine woods and the stony shore, made the fire-side of the pond; it is so much
               pleasanter and wholesomer to be warmed by the sun while you can be, than by an
               artificial fire. I thus warmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer,
               like a departed hunter, had left.

                  Well-Meadow,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-15-028"></anchor> now from the Baker Farm. For a long time he stood

               his place and listened to the hounds. Still on they came, and now the near woods resounded through all
               their aisles with their demoniac cry. At length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground,
               and snapping the air as if possessed, and ran directly to the rock; but spying the <app xml:id="walc15-app-0111">

               in silence; and one by one her pups arrived, and, like their mother, were sobered into silence by the

               off, the sprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment, and they become more numerous than
               ever. That must be a poor country indeed that does not support a hare. Our woods teem with them both, and

                  with grown perch for bait. You look into his pail with wonder as into a summer
                  pond, as if he kept summer locked up at home, or knew where she had retreated.
                  How, pray, did he get these in mid-winter? O, he got worms out of rotten logs
                  since the ground froze, and so he caught them. His life itself passes deeper in
                  Nature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate; himself a subject for the
                  naturalist. The latter raises the moss and bark gently with his knife in search of
                  insects; the former lays open logs to their core with his axe, and moss and bark
                  fly far and wide. He gets his living by barking trees. Such a man has <app xml:id="walc16-app-0020">

                        it was covered with snow a dozen men were incessantly engaged scraping this
                        off over an area of several acres with various kinds of scrapers drawn by
                        horses. Two followed with a horse &amp; a slight cutter, one carefully
                        leading the horse while the other guided the cutter within a few inches of a
                        rope drawn straight across the ice for 10 or a dozen rods. Such a groove was
                        made on two sides of a parallelogram. Then with various kinds of gage
                        cutters, that is cutters connected by a frame with parallel smooth or
                        toothless plates <add>at a proper distance</add> on one or both sides,
                        running in the last made groove the whole area was finally grooved in
                        squares 22 inches on a side, yet not so weakened but that horses could work
                        on it. I was told that the best ice cutters or plows cost over a hundred
                        dollars, and cut 4 inches at a bout but it was hard work for a horse. Other
                        men were employed with whipsaws cutting this area into long strips the width
                        of a cake; half a dozen poling the strips along a narrow canal to the
                        loading place—near which one stood with a spade-like chisel to cut off the
                        "cakes," which consisted of two squares &amp; therefore measured 22 by 44
                        inches. These cakes were to be finally divided by the shallow groove at the
                        loading aboard ship, so that one man might handle them. At the end of the
                        canal were a dozen or 15 men half on each side incessantly hauling the cakes
                        up a narrow iron framework or railway, sunk at one end on wood and resting
                        on a sled at the other, with pike staffs which had a double point, one bent
                        for hauling, the other straight for pushing. Each sled held 14 or 15 cakes
                        which weighed about 2 tons and were drawn by one horse over the ice to the

                  village street, and lies there for a week like a great emerald, an object of
                  interest to all passers. I have noticed that a portion of Walden which in the
                  state of water was green will often, when frozen, appear from the same point of
                  view blue. So the hollows about this pond will, sometimes, in the winter, be
                  filled with a greenish water somewhat like its own, but the next day will have
                  frozen blue. Perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to the light and air
                  they contain, and the most transparent is the bluest.</seg>

               of the astonished artist into the fairest of all the creations of Brahma. He had made

               old table of apple-tree wood, which had stood in a farmer’s kitchen for sixty years,
               first in Connecticut, and afterward in Massachusetts,—from an egg deposited in the
               living tree many years earlier still, as appeared by counting the annual layers
               beyond it; which was heard gnawing out for several weeks, hatched perchance by the
               heat of an urn. Who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and immortality
               strengthened by hearing of this? Who knows what beautiful and winged life, whose egg
               has been buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry
               life of society, deposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree,
               which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its well-seasoned
               tomb,—heard perchance gnawing out now for years by the astonished family of man, as
               they sat round the festive board,—may unexpectedly come forth from amidst society’s
